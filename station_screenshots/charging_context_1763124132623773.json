This discrepancy could be a sign of a misconfiguration, an error, or a deliberate attempt to mislead users, which can be a precursor to or a component of a cyberattack (e.g., bait-and-switch, or testing different phishing lures). The image of the EV and charging station appears realistic, likely a stock photo, but without further analysis, cannot be definitively ruled out as AI-generated or deepfake; however, its primary suspicious aspect is the context of the discount inconsistency."}, {"trial": 3, "kiosk": 3, "image": "deepfake2.png", "attack": "Safe", "cyber_attacked": false, "charge_amount": 20, "points_after": 350.0, "ending_charge": 37.0, "visual_content": "", "anomalies": ""}, {"trial": 4, "kiosk": 3, "image": "real7.png", "attack": "Safe", "cyber_attacked": false, "charge_amount": 20, "points_after": 330.0, "ending_charge": 44.0, "visual_content": "", "anomalies": ""}, {"trial": 5, "kiosk": 3, "image": "deepfake6.png", "attack": "Cyber Attack", "cyber_attacked": true, "charge_amount": 5, "points_after": 305.0, "ending_charge": 38.0, "visual_content": "", "anomalies": ""}]
