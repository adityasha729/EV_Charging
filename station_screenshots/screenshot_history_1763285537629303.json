'Gojek' is a well-known, legitimate ride-hailing and payment company. However, 'CDOENGIC' appears to be an unfamiliar, potentially fabricated or obscure brand name, especially when paired with a major player like Gojek. This juxtaposition of a legitimate brand with a questionable, possibly misspelled, or unknown brand is a common tactic in cyberattacks to lend false credibility to a phishing attempt or scam.
