The text reads 'SAVE 20% OFF YOUR FIRST CHARGE' and 'Valid for new users only. Limited time offer.'.

Additionally, a yellow banner above the coupon states 'Special 10% Discount Available!'.\",\n        \"Anomalies\": \"Yes, several anomalies: \\n1. **Conflicting Discounts**: The yellow banner above the coupon advertises a 'Special 10% Discount Available!', while the coupon itself offers 'SAVE 20% OFF YOUR FIRST CHARGE'. This inconsistency can be a tactic to confuse users or bait them into clicking.\\n2. **Inconsistent Branding**: The coupon introduces 'ChargeHub' branding, which is distinct from the overarching 'EV Charging Network' branding of the interface. While multi-partner promotions exist, the sudden appearance of a new brand within a specific kiosk's promotion without clear integration or explanation is suspicious.\\n3. **External Link/QR Code**: The presence of a QR code and a URL ('chargehub.com/promos') associated with the 'ChargeHub' brand could be a phishing attempt. Users might be redirected to an external, potentially malicious website that mimics a legitimate service to collect credentials or payment information, especially given the inconsistent branding and discounts.\\n4. **Unrealistic Discount (Combined with inconsistency)**: While a 20% first-time discount isn't inherently unrealistic, its conflict with the 10% offer shown for the same kiosk (and Kiosk 1) makes it appear more suspect, potentially designed to lure users with a higher, but misleading, offer.\"\n    }\n}\n", "4": "mini API Error: 503 UNAVAILABLE. {'error': {'code': 503, 'message': 'The model is overloaded.
