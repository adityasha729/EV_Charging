How It Works
You start with 400 points — your currency for the game
At one of the charging Kiosk, you decide how much to charge your EV (1 point = 1% charge)
After charging, a simulated drive will drain some charge from your battery
The game includes multiple stations, and you must visit all to be eligible for rewards

Real Rewards Await!

Only participants who complete the game by visiting all the stations will qualify.

🎲
Twists and Surprises
Each station has some chance of giving you a discount coupon (10% off) on the charging amount
You can skip charging if "you're" confident that your vehicle can reach the next station — but risky moves may leave you stranded!
📊
After visiting Every Station, "You'll" See:
Points spent on charging
Your starting and ending battery levels
Charge lost during the simulated drive
This feedback helps you adjust your strategy in the next round.
