Kiosk 3 has a history of cyberattacks  so it's best to avoid it. Kiosk 2 is similar to Kiosk 3  so using it is not advisable. Kiosk 1 has been safe in the past  despite the branding inconsistency  making it the safer option currently.

Both Kiosk 1 and Kiosk 2 are displaying ""No Active Promotions"" and have been safe in the past. However  Kiosk 3 is occupied  so it is unavailable.  I recommend either Kiosk 1 or Kiosk 2 as they both appear safe and available. The ""No Active Promotions"" display reduces the risk of encountering potentially malicious or inconsistent promotional content."

Both Kiosk 1 and Kiosk 2 display the same inconsistency between the banner and the coupon  which is suspicious. However  Kiosk 1 has a history of being safe. Kiosk 3 is currently unavailable.  Therefore  I recommend using **Kiosk 1**. Although there's a minor anomaly  it has been safe in the past. Please be cautious and double-check any discounts before confirming the transaction.

Kiosk 3 is currently occupied.  Kiosk 2 appears safe with a clear and consistent ""10% OFF DISCOUNT ON CHARGING"" promotion. I recommend using Kiosk 2 for a safer charging experience."
