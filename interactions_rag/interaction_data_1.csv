1,real6.png,Safe,0,20,0,20.0,0,32,52.0,deepfake6.png,Cyber Attack,,,0,,,,,None,None,,,0,,,,,Given your current charge and the need to reach 20 stations  you should charge at this station.  Kiosk 1 has a promotion directing to an external website  which could be a potential phishing risk  but has been tried and tested before. Kiosk 2 has multiple anomalies including misspelled text and a suspicious QR code. Kiosk 3 is currently occupied.  I recommend using Kiosk 1  as it is the least risky option available despite the external website promotion.

Kiosk 1 has inconsistent discount offers which may indicate a UI error or deceptive advertising. Kiosk 2 has a plausible Gojek promotion for its drivers  which is safer. Kiosk 3 is currently occupied  making it unavailable.

It displays a straightforward '10% OFF EV CHARGING' promotion with no apparent anomalies.  Kiosk 2 is occupied  and Kiosk 3 shows multiple red flags  including inconsistent discount offers and unusual branding  suggesting a higher risk of cyberattack. Kiosk 1 has been deemed safe in the past.

Kiosk 2 and Kiosk 3 both display inconsistencies between the header (10% discount) and the promotional graphics (30% discount or unlimited charge)  which is a red flag. Also  Kiosk 3 displays ""Unlimited Charge Session"" which is highly unrealistic.  Kiosk 2 also has past history of discount inconsistency  but is slightly less risky than Kiosk 3.  Therefore  I recommend using Kiosk 2 with caution. Please ensure you double-check all prompts and URLs before entering any information."

Kiosk 1 has a history of cyberattacks  making it a risky choice despite its current appearance. Kiosk 2 is currently occupied. While Kiosk 3 has displayed some inconsistencies in the past  it has not been directly associated with cyberattacks. It also offers a reasonable 10% discount  and the graphics are not suspicious.

All three kiosks are displaying ""No Active Promotions"" which reduces the risk of encountering malicious content. Since all kiosks have similar cyberattack chances  any of them are a good choice."
