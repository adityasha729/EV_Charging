10,deepfake8.png,Cyber Attack,,,0,,,,,real4.png,Safe,,,0,,,,,real8.png,Safe,0,20,0,20.0,0,52.0,72.0,Given the cyberattack history  I would advise against Kiosk 1 and Kiosk 2 due to previous cyberattacks and suspicious anomalies like misspellings and branding issues. Kiosk 3 has inconsistencies in discount offers  which is a potential red flag  but it's the least risky option available. Therefore  I recommend using **Kiosk 3** with caution  carefully verifying all information before proceeding.

Kiosk 2 directs you to an external website  which is a potential phishing risk. Based on previous data  Kiosk 2 has a high chance of phishing attacks.  Kiosk 1 is the safest option. It offers a straightforward discount related to charging  with no external redirection.

Kiosk 2 displays a highly suspicious ""SAVE 30% EV POWER UNLIMITED CHARGE SESSIONS"" offer  which is likely a bait-and-switch tactic. Kiosk 3 is currently occupied. Kiosk 1 shows a simple and consistent 10% discount  which is safer despite Kiosk 1 being previously compromised."

All kiosks are currently displaying ""No Active Promotions "" which reduces the risk of encountering deceptive advertising. However  since you've experienced cyberattacks with similar ""No Active Promotions"" displays on Kiosk 2 and Kiosk 3 previously  Kiosk 1 is the safest option available at this station."
