Your battery level is critically low  and based on your gaze data  you didn't focus on any specific kiosk  indicating you might be unsure about their safety.  Kiosk 2 and 3 both redirect to external websites  which poses a phishing risk. Kiosk 1 is safer but given you have very low charge  it is not advisable to experiment. Since you focused on your battery and points  it seems you're aware of your limited charge. Skipping is the safest option here to ensure you reach the next station.

Kiosk 1 has a clear indication of ""EV DEEPFAKE "" and its history shows repeated cyberattacks. Kiosk 2 offers an unrealistic ""UNLIMITED CHARGE SESSIONS"" deal  making it highly suspicious  similar to what you faced before. While Kiosk 3 has a past history of cyberattack  this time it appears to be the safest option  with a simple and realistic 10% discount.  Your gaze data indicates you spent the most time looking at Kiosk 3 and Battery container & points section  suggesting you are mindful of your current charge level and are looking for more secure options."
9,None,None,,,0,,,,,real9.png,Safe,,,0,,,,,real4.png,Safe,0,50,0,50.0,0,43.0,93.0,Given your history with compromised kiosks displaying promotional discounts  and considering your current charge and points  I advise against Kiosk 2 as it has displayed Cyberattacks previously.  Kiosk 1 has had safe trials previously and has been viewed more by you so it should be relatively safer. Kiosk 3 has also been safe previously but was not viewed more by you.

Kiosk 1 has a history of cyberattacks  and both Kiosk 1 and Kiosk 3 have conflicting discount information  which can be a sign of manipulation. Kiosk 2 has a clean design and recognized brands. Your gaze was primarily on Kiosk 2 and Kiosk 3  but given the cyberattack history of similar kiosks as Kiosk 3  Kiosk 2 is safer.

Kiosk 2 has a spelling error (""DISCOOUNT"")  a common sign of phishing attempts. Kiosk 1 is occupied  so it is unavailable. While Kiosk 3 has been cyberattacked in the past  the current visual content has no anomalies and appears safe.  Based on your gaze distribution  you seemed more interested in Kiosk 2. But considering the high risk  choosing the safer option  Kiosk 3  is recommended."

Kiosk 1 and Kiosk 2 both redirect you to external websites for discounts  which could be risky. Kiosk 3 offers a straightforward 10% discount directly  without external links  which is safer. While Kiosk 3 has had one incident of cyberattack in the past  it is still comparatively safer than the other two kiosks. Also  your gaze distribution suggests you were more interested in Kiosk 3.
