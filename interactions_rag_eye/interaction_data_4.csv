I see you've spent a considerable amount of time looking at Kiosk 2. However  based on the information  Kiosk 1 has a history of cyberattacks and displays a deepfake coupon. Kiosk 2 also has a coupon  which has a possibility of being AI generated. Kiosk 3 appears to be the safest option  with a legitimate-looking ""ChargeHub"" promotion. Therefore  I recommend using **Kiosk 3**."

Here's why: Kiosk 1 has a history of cyberattacks related to misspelled discount codes. Kiosk 3's ""unlimited charge"" offer is highly suspicious. Kiosk 2  while directing to an external website  has shown safe history in the past. As you spent a significant time on Kiosk 3  I understand you may be inclined towards the offers  but it is best to avoid it for now."

Based on the information and your gaze distribution  all kiosks are displaying ""No Active Promotions"" and are equally safe currently. However  Kiosk 2 has a history of being safe. Since your gaze was more on Kiosk 2  I would recommend Kiosk 2 for charging."
9,deepfake3.png,Safe,,,0,,,,,deepfake5.png,Cyber Attack,,,0,,,,,real7.png,Safe,0,20,0,20.0,0,19.0,39.0,Given your current charge and the cyberattack history  I would recommend **Kiosk 1**.  Both Kiosk 1 and 2 present a simple 10% off promotion and have similar visuals. However  both Kiosks have had prior cyberattacks. Kiosk 3 displays a 'ChargeHub' promotion which  while potentially legitimate  has shown inconsistencies in the past and also has a history of cyberattacks. Your gaze data shows you spent very little time on Kiosk 1  which means it is likely that you found no anomalies on the kiosk.
10,real8.png,Safe,0,20,0,20.0,0,32.0,52.0,None,None,,,0,,,,,deepfake3.png,Cyber Attack,,,0,,,,,Given your remaining journey  points  and current charge  let's find the safest option for you.  Kiosk 2 is occupied  so we can't consider it.  Between Kiosk 1 and Kiosk 3  Kiosk 3 has a higher chance of cyberattack. The promotional banners on Kiosk 1 are common and although there is a small chance of phishing  Kiosk 3 has been cyberattacked in the past.  Considering your gaze distribution  you spent significantly more time viewing Kiosk 1  indicating a potential interest or perceived anomaly.  Therefore  I recommend using Kiosk 1.
12,deepfake1.png,Cyber Attack,,,0,,,,,None,None,,,0,,,,,real4.png,Safe,0,25,0,25.0,0,33.0,58.0,Given your current charge of 33% and the need to reach your destination  charging is necessary. Kiosk 2 is currently occupied.  Kiosk 1 displays an 'EV DEEPFAKE' message directly on the coupon  indicating a high risk of cyberattack  also Kiosk 1 has been compromised in the past with the same type of attack. Kiosk 3 offers a promotion for 'Gojek driver-partners'  which seems less risky. Also  Kiosk 3 was safe in the past. Considering your gaze distribution  you spent considerable time looking at Kiosk 1  possibly identifying the deepfake warning. I recommend using Kiosk 3.
13,deepfake5.png,Cyber Attack,,,0,,,,,deepfake7.png,Cyber Attack,,,0,,,,,deepfake3.png,Cyber Attack,0,10,0,20.0,10.0,48.0,58.0,Given your current charge of 48% and points balance of 175  skipping might be a viable option  but let's explore the safest charging option first.   Based on the kiosk descriptions  I would recommend Kiosk 3. Kiosk 1 has a history of cyberattacks. Kiosk 2 shows an unrealistic offer of unlimited charge sessions  making it high-risk. Kiosk 3 shows a simple 10% discount  which is likely the safest option.  The user gaze distribution shows you looked at kiosk 3 more than Kiosk 1  so I believe this is the best choice for you.
15,deepfake9.png,Cyber Attack,0,10,0,20.0,10.0,44.0,54.0,real9.png,Safe,,,0,,,,,real6.png,Safe,,,0,,,,,Given your current charge and points  I recommend using Kiosk 1.  Kiosk 2 and 3 both direct you to external websites ('chargehub.com/promo' and 'evchargers.com.au' respectively) for discounts  which is a potential phishing risk. Kiosk 3 was also attacked in the past. Kiosk 1 had a cyberattack in the past.  Although Kiosk 1 has a discount discrepancy (10% vs 20%)  it does not involve external websites. Your gaze data shows minimal interest in Kiosk 1  but significant interest in Kiosk 3. However  based on security  Kiosk 1 is the safest option currently.

Kiosk 2 is the safest option.  Here's why: Kiosk 1 has a misspelled word  ""DISCOOUNT "" which indicates a high probability of phishing. Kiosk 3 has multiple spelling and grammatical errors  including the suspicious brand name ""EV DEEPPE""  making it the riskiest. Kiosk 2 has no immediately apparent anomalies and has a history of being safe. Also  you spent a significant amount of time viewing Kiosk 2  indicating that you might find it most appealing and safe."
20,deepfake3.png,Cyber Attack,,,0,,,,,real7.png,Safe,0,10,0,10.0,0,10.0,20.0,real7.png,Cyber Attack,,,0,,,,,Given your current charge of 10% and the history of cyberattacks at previous kiosks  your safest option is to use Kiosk 1. Although Kiosk 1 has faced cyberattacks in the past  the visual content currently displays no anomalies. Kiosks 2 and 3 both show a discount inconsistency  which has been a potential entry point for previous cyberattacks. Also  the gaze distribution data shows that you were least interested in Kiosk 1  hence it is more likely to be safer.
