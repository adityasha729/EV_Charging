Text includes 'ZAP!', '20% OFF EV CHARGE!', 'SUPERCHARGE YOUR RIDE!', 'Valid for 1 time use', and 'Scan to redeem', along with a barcode graphic.. Anomalies: The promotional banner states 'Special 10% Discount Available!' while the coupon itself advertises '20% OFF', creating a direct inconsistency in the discount value. The cartoonish, retro branding ('ZAP!', 'SUPERCHARGE YOUR RIDE!') is unconventional for an EV charging service, which often uses more professional or sleek designs, suggesting a potentially unofficial or tampered promotion. No explicit deepfake or AI-generated image markers are present, but the stylistic clash and discount discrepancy are suspicious.",

Text includes 'UNLOCK HUGE SAVINGS', 'GET 30% OFF ALL CHARGES THIS MONTH', and 'Limited-time offer for ElectroCharge members.' An image shows a silver electric SUV parked near a charging station. A coupon code 'CHARGE30' is displayed with an 'APPLY NOW' button. Small text below mentions 'Terms & conditions apply. www.electrocharge.com/promos only' (partially visible). There are no QR codes or faces.. Anomalies: The branding 'ElectroCharge' in this kiosk differs from the 'ChargeHub' branding seen in Kiosks 2 and 3. While a multi-partner platform can host different brands, this inconsistency could be a potential attack vector if content from one brand were compromised or spoofed under another's legitimate branding. The 'Special 10% Discount Available!' banner also appears above the 30% off coupon, which might cause slight ambiguity regarding the total discount amount. However, no immediate signs of deepfake images, overtly unrealistic discounts, or phishing prompts are present.",

The image appears authentic with no signs of deepfake or AI generation. The branding ('ChargeHub') and its corresponding URL are consistent. While Kiosk 1 and Kiosk 2 display different brand promotions, this alone does not indicate a cyberattack, as it could be part of a multi-brand advertising strategy or platform feature.",

A coupon code 'EVSTART20' is shown with a 'COPY CODE' button, and a small URL 'chargerhub.com/promos' is visible at the bottom.. Anomalies: The same anomaly as Kiosk 1 is present: a discrepancy between the 'Special 10% Discount Available!' banner and the 'SAVE 20% OFF YOUR FIRST CHARGE' offer. The repetition of this inconsistency across multiple kiosks strengthens the possibility of it being a system-wide misconfiguration or a deliberate tactic. While it could be a simple display error, in a security analysis, repeated inconsistencies like this are red flags that could indicate a flaw being exploited or a subtle form of deception.",
